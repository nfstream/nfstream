    Reimplementation of SPLT native analysis as NFPlugin: For testing and demo purposes.
    SPLT: Sequence of packet length and time analyzer.
    This plugin will take 2 arguments:
        - sequence_length: determines the maximum sequence length (number of packets to analyze)
        - accounting_mode: Set how packet size will be reported (0: raw_size,
                                                                 1: ip_size,

    Plugin will generate 3 new metrics as follows:
    - splt_directions: Array with direction of each packet (0: src_to_dst, 1:dst_to_src)
    - splt_ps: Array with packet size in bytes according to accounting_mode value.
    - splt_ipt: Array with inter packet arrival time in milliseconds.
    Note: Tail will be set with default value -1.
